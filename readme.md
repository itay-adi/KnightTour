# Knight's Tour

A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly
once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the
board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed; otherwise, it is open.

* The KnightsTour is using the [bitArray](https://github.com/itay-adi/DataStructures/tree/main/bit_array)
